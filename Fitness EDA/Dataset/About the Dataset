The dataset provides comprehensive information on individuals’ daily physical activity, sleep patterns, and body measurements. 
It contains 12,625 records and 18 features, combining both activity tracking and health metrics. 
The numerical features include daily step counts, calories burned, time spent in different activity levels (sedentary, lightly, fairly, and very active),distances covered, and total minutes of sleep and bed time. Additionally, it includes personal health indicators such as weight (in kg), height (in meters), and BMI. 
The categorical feature ActivityDayName represents the day of the week for each record. 
Overall, this dataset offers valuable insights into how physical activity, rest, and body composition relate to overall fitness levels, making it suitable for exploratory data analysis, correlation studies, and predictive modeling in health and wellness analytics.
