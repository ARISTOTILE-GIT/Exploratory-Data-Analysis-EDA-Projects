The Titanic dataset contains detailed information about 891 passengers who were aboard the RMS Titanic during its ill-fated voyage. 
It includes attributes such as passenger ID, name, age, gender, ticket class, fare paid, cabin, number of family members aboard, and the port of embarkation. 
The key feature, Survived, indicates whether a passenger lived or perished in the disaster. 
This dataset serves as a classic example for data analysis and machine learning tasks, particularly for studying classification problems and understanding 
factors that influenced survival rates, such as gender, age, and passenger class. Some columns, like Age and Cabin, contain missing values, 
making it suitable for exploring data cleaning and preprocessing techniques.
